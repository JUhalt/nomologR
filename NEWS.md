# nomologR 0.0.0.9000

## Milestone 1B — psychometric screening

- Added corrected item-rest and inter-item relationship diagnostics for
  explicitly scored numeric/logical candidate items.
- Added review guidance for negative and weak item-rest relationships without
  automatic reverse-scoring or deletion.
- Added configurable response-concentration and near-zero-variance screening.
- Added descriptive floor/ceiling concentration for ordered and
  numeric-discrete items where those boundaries are meaningful.
- Added descriptive skewness and excess kurtosis for continuous-like numeric
  indicators without normality pass/fail declarations.
- Expanded `nomo_screen()` printing and tests for the psychometric screening layer.
- Refocused the README on the `contentvalidR` -> `nomologR` measurement workflow
  and the active v0.1 development path.
- Added a GitHub issue form for roadmap-milestone tracking.

## Milestone 1 — item/data screening

- Implemented the first production slice of `nomo_screen()`.
- Added conservative item-type descriptions, item-level missingness and response
  summaries, response distributions, case-level completeness diagnostics, and
  explicit zero-variance/all-missing flags.
- Added an evidence-guided decision log for screening observations without
  automatically deleting items or cases.
- Added a concise `print.nomo_screen()` method.
- Added focused tests for input validation, type classification, missingness,
  response distributions, case completeness, decision logging, and the
  non-destructive workflow.
- Updated GitHub Actions checkout steps to `actions/checkout@v5` for the Node 24
  runtime.

## Foundation milestone

- Defined `nomologR` as a guided workflow for empirical scale development and
  construct-validity evidence rather than a replacement for `psych`, `lavaan`,
  or `semTools`.
- Clarified the package boundary relative to `contentvalidR` and `solomonR`.
- Standardized package naming and the planned public API on the `nomo_*` prefix.
- Reframed common numerical cutoffs as teaching/reference values rather than
  automatic pass/fail rules.
- Established the principle that the package flags, explains, and documents but
  never silently deletes items or respecifies models.
- Updated planned reliability methods to current `semTools` infrastructure such
  as `compRelSEM()`.
- Updated planned measurement-invariance methods to current `semTools`
  infrastructure such as `measEq.syntax()`.
- Separated AVE/convergent evidence from reliability.
- Added a testable internal decision-log scaffold.
- Cleaned development and continuous-integration scaffolding for the public
  GitHub repository.
