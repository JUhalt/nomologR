# nomologR 0.0.0.9000

## Foundation milestone

- Defined `nomologR` as a guided workflow for empirical scale development and
  construct-validity evidence rather than a replacement for `psych`, `lavaan`,
  or `semTools`.
- Clarified the package boundary relative to `contentvalidR` and `solomonR`.
- Standardized package naming and the planned public API on the `nomo_*` prefix.
- Reframed common numerical cutoffs as teaching/reference values rather than
  automatic pass/fail rules.
- Established the principle that the package flags, explains, and documents but
  never silently deletes items or respecifies models.
- Updated planned reliability methods to current `semTools` infrastructure such
  as `compRelSEM()`.
- Updated planned measurement-invariance methods to current `semTools`
  infrastructure such as `measEq.syntax()`.
- Separated AVE/convergent evidence from reliability.
- Added a testable internal decision-log scaffold.
- Cleaned development and continuous-integration scaffolding for the public
  GitHub repository.
